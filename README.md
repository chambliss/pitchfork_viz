# Visualization Interface for Pitchfork Music Reviews

This repo is a work-in-progress. The goal is to use review articles of songs and albums scraped from the website pitchfork.com to visualize the relationships between music artists and genres. I started this project as a way to learn [d3.js](https://nolanbconaway.github.io/) (and interactive data visualization with JavaScript in general), so please follow along if you're interested!

Credit to [Nolan Conaway](https://nolanbconaway.github.io/) for initially scraping these reviews and [putting them up on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) as a queryable sqlite database. Thanks Nolan!
